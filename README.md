# Boilerpat Micro

Boilerpat Micro is a boilerplate files to bootstrap static HTML creations, mostly focusing on static one to a couple of pages of microsites need. This is the workflow that I regularly use to make simple microsites, hope it would be useful to you too.

Boilerpat Micro contains:

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
* Bourbon
* Neat
* [Assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/)

## Prerequisites
You'll need the following tools to get the full advantages of this workflow:

### Ruby
On OS X, you'll already have Ruby installed. On Windows, see http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/.

### Sass and Compass

Make sure you have Ruby installed before this step.

Install Sass: http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html.

Install Compass: http://compass-style.org/install/.

    npm uninstall -g grunt
    npm install -g grunt-cli

After installing grunt-cli (Grunt's command line interface) globally, go to the
project folder and install all the dependencies listed in package.json. This will
install a local version of Grunt as well.

## Documentation

### Grunt

A grunt build system has been added to this project. There are two build systems.

* Development Server (grunt server) 
    - Build static HTML pages using Assemble
    - Compiles **SASS** for files in css/sass in to single expanded **main.css**
    - Runs JSHint on all JS files
* Final build (grunt)
    - Build static HTML pages using Assemble
    - Compiles SASS for files in css/sass in to single minified MAIN.CSS file.
    - Runs JSHint on all JS files, excluding files in the "vendor" directory.
    - Concatinates all JS files.
    - Uglifies concatinated js file.
    - Compresses JPG and PNG images.

For details about all the tasks and processes, see documentation in Gruntfile:
